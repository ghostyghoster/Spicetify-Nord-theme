# Spicetify-Nord-theme
A spicetify theme that I based off of the Nord theme color palette.
I don't like it when the spicetify changes the player bar, and makes it difficult to click the scrubber ball / bar without accidentally clicking something else.
So basically, this is just a few custom colors combined with the near entire user.css stolen from the Black theme.
